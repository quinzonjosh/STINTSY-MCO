    "The garment industry plays a crucial role in today's industrial globalization as this labor-intesive sector relies heavily manual processes and in order to meet the global demands for clothing and textile products, the industry must ensure efficient production and delivery of the employees of garment manufacturing companies. Decision-makers or those of high positions in the garment industry makes this happen by systematically monitoring, analyzing, and predicting the productivity performance of the different teams that work within their factories. This makes it possible for companies in the industry to gain a competitive advantage in the market. <br><br>\n",

The data was sourced from the data analysis of the performance records of the Garment Company, extracting information related to garment productions and the actual productivity rate compared to the targeted productivity rate. A similar study by Balla et al. (2021), utilized Machine Learning techniques to be able to predict the productivity rate of garment employees based on the Garment Dataset by analyzing and identifying the patterns that are not apparent in statistical methods. The insights from this study can potentially enhance the efficiency of garment workers, leading to a boost in the overall profitability of the clothing industry. \n",
