    "The garment industry plays a crucial role in today's industrial globalization as this labor-intesive sector relies heavily manual processes and in order to meet the global demands for clothing and textile products, the industry must ensure efficient production and delivery of the employees of garment manufacturing companies. Decision-makers or those of high positions in the garment industry makes this happen by systematically monitoring, analyzing, and predicting the productivity performance of the different teams that work within their factories. This makes it possible for companies in the industry to gain a competitive advantage in the market. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to systematically monitor, analyze, and predict the productivity performance of the teams in factories, a comprehensive dataset has been built, covering important attributes related to the garment manufacturing process and the productivity of employees. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers, data scientists, and industry professionals to understand the industry on a deeper level by looking at different factors contributing to the productivity of the industry. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This project's primary objective is to predict and analyze the productivity performance of working teams in garment manufacturing companies. The target of this project is to develop models and generate insights that can predict the productivity of the teams in the garment industry based on the provided attributes. Being able to do so will greatly help decision-makers to make data-driven decision to improve the overall efficiency and competitiveness of their garment manufacturing operations"
